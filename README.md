These StyleSheets and Configuration Files for [TaskPaper](http://www.taskpaper.com) is great if:

* You are a "Tomorrow Night Eighties" theme enthusiast
* You like Omnifocus style default searches
* You like having similar color scheme between your Day/Night time themes

## Install the StyleSheets

1. [Download the zip][download] and open the zip folder
2. `Window` menu > `StyleSheet` > `Open StyleSheet Folder` *<-- from within TaskPaper*
3. Copy both `.less` files from the zip `StyleSheet` folder to the TaskPaper `StyleSheet` Folder
4. `Window` menu > `StyleSheet` > `.less` *<-- also from within TaskPaper*

## Install the Configuration Files

1. [Download the zip][download] and open the zip folder
2. `Window` menu > `StyleSheet` > `Open StyleSheet Folder` *<-- from within TaskPaper*
3. Go back a level in the `StyleSheet` folder and open the `Configurations` folder
    - You should now be located in /`Application Support` > `Taskpaper` > `Configurations`
3. Copy and overwrite both `searches.taskpaper` and `tags.taskpaper` files from the zip `Configurations` folder to the TaskPaper `Configurations` Folder
    - I recommend backing up the files from within /`Application Support` > `Taskpaper` > `Configurations` before proceeding in case you want to revert to the default settings at a later date.
4. Done.
