These StyleSheets and Configuration Files for [TaskPaper](http://www.taskpaper.com) is great if:

* You are a "Tomorrow Night Eighties" theme enthusiast
* You like Omnifocus style default searches
* You like having similar color scheme between your Day/Night time themes

## Install the StyleSheets

1. [Download the zip][download] and open the zip file
2. `Window` menu > `StyleSheet` > `Open StyleSheet directory` *<-- from within TaskPaper*
3. Copy both `.less` files from the zip `StyleSheet` directory to the TaskPaper `StyleSheet` directory
4. `Window` menu > `StyleSheet` > `.less` *<-- also from within TaskPaper*

## Install the Configuration Files

1. [Download the zip][download] and open the zip file
2. `Window` menu > `StyleSheet` > `Open StyleSheet directory` *<-- from within TaskPaper*
3. Go back a level in the `StyleSheet` directory and open the `Configurations` directory
    - You should now be located in `/Application Support/Taskpaper/Configurations`
3. Copy and overwrite both `searches.taskpaper` and `tags.taskpaper` files from the zip `Configurations` directory to the TaskPaper `Configurations` directory
    - I recommend backing up the files in `/Application Support/Taskpaper/Configurations` before proceeding in case you need to revert to the default settings at a later date.
4. Done.

## Get the Scripts

1. [Download the zip][download] and open the zip directory
2. The scripts and Keyboard Maestro macros are accessible in the `scripts` directory from the zip:
    - **dueRefresh** = Script that add/amend/remove tags to `@dueTomorrow`, `@dueToday` and `@pastDue` items when the due tag/date match `@tagName(yyyy-mm-dd)`.
      - It remove any `@defer` tags if the tag date expired (ex. `@defer(2011-03-02)` where the date is <= today)
      - It does not add @pastDue tags on items tagged with `@done`, `@status(completed)`, `@status(delivered)` or `@status(cancelled)`
    - **doneSort** = Script that group and sort `@done(date)` items at the bottom of the project list of items in ascending order by date. Items with a `@status` tag are then pushed at the bottom and sorted by ascending `@done(date)` as well.
3. General script usage instructions available on TP3 guide and support forum.
